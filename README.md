# Recipe Management API
The web application allows users to manage your favorite recipes.

### Required tools to run the API
- JDK 8
- Maven
- Eclipse or IntelliJ Idea
- Lombok plugin for IDE
- Docker Desktop (optional, you can run on your PC)
- PostgreSQL (optional, you can use H2 DB)

## 1- Running on your PC
API config file includes two DB configurations: PostgreSQL and H2 in-memory DB. The project uses H2 DB as default. If you have PostgreSQL on your PC, you can change the configuration. You donâ€™t need to do anything if you want to run with H2 DB. The configuration file name is application.yml under the resources directory.

- H2 DB URL: http://localhost:8080/api/recipeManagement/v1/h2-console
- User Name: admin
- Password: admin
- JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb

## Run the below commands at the root of the project directory. You can also do the below on your IDE.
Build Recipe API using maven.
```
mvn clean install
```
Run spring boot application.
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## 2- Running on Docker
API includes docker config files which are docker file and docker-compose file. Docker creates two containers. The first one is for spring application, and the second is for PostgreSQL DB. Docker uses the application-docker.yml file under the resources directory for application config.

## Run the below commands at the root of the project directory.
Build Recipe API using maven.
```
mvn clean install
```
Create containerized images for the application using a docker-compose command.
```
docker-compose build
```
Run all containers using the single command as below.
```
docker-compose up
```
*In addition, **to stop all containers**, you can use the following command.*
```
docker-compose down
```
